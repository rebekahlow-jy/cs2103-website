    <p>While it is possible to isolate the functionalities of a software system into modules, there is no way to remove interaction between modules. When modules interact with each other, coupling naturally increases. Consequently, it is harder to localize
      any changes to the software system. In 1988, Bertrand Meyer proposed a guiding principle to alleviate this problem. The principle, known as the <em>open-closed principle</em>, states: ‚ÄúA module should be <em>open</em> for extension but <em>closed</em>      for modification‚Äù. That is, modules should be written so that they can be extended, without requiring them to be modified. In other words, changing what the modules do without changing the source code of the modules.</p>
    <p>In object-oriented programming, these two seemingly opposing requirements can be achieved in various ways. This often requires separating the <em>specification (interface)</em> of a module from its <em>implementation</em>.</p>

      <p>Example:</p><img src="/cs2103-website/designPrinciples/openClosedPrinciple/what/images/commandQueue.png" height="170">
      <p></p>
      <p>The behavior of the <code>CommandQueue</code> class can be altered by adding more concrete <code>Command</code> subclasses. For example, by including a <code>Delete</code> class alongside <code>List</code>, <code>Sort</code>, and <code>Reset</code>,
        the <code>CommandQueue</code> can now perform delete commands without modifying its code at all. Indeed, its behavior was extended without having to open up and modify its code. Hence, it was open to extensions, but closed to modification.</p>

      <p>The behavior of a Java generic class can be altered by passing it a different class as a parameter. In the code below, the <code>ArrayList</code> class behaves as a container of <code>Students</code> in one instance and as a container of <code>Admin</code>        objects in the other instance, without having to change its code. That is, the behavior of the <code>ArrayList</code> class is extended without modifying its code.</p>
      <pre><code class="hljs java">ArrayList students = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> ArrayList&lt; Student &gt;();
ArrayList admins = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> ArrayList&lt; Admin &gt;();  	
</code></pre>
