    <p>Here are some tips on writing effective documentation.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use plenty of diagrams: It is not enough to explain something in words; complement it with visual illustrations (e.g. a UML diagram).</li>
      <li>Use plenty of examples: When explaining algorithms, show a running example to illustrate each step of the algorithm, in parallel to worded explanations.</li>
      <li>Use simple and direct explanations: Convoluted explanations and fancy words will annoy readers. Avoid long sentences.</li>
      <li>Get rid of statements that do not add value. For example, 'We made sure our system works perfectly' (who didn't?), 'Component X has its own responsibilities' (of course it has!).</li>
      <li>It is not a good idea to have separate sections for each type of artifact, such as 'use cases', 'sequence diagrams', 'activity diagrams', etc. Such a structure, coupled with the mindless inclusion of diagrams without justifying their need, indicates
        a failure to understand the purpose of documentation. Include diagrams when they are needed to explain the system. If it is a must to provide a comprehensive collection of diagrams, include them in the appendix as a reference.</li>
    </ul>
