<div id="handbook-faq-highWorkload"><img src="/cs2103-website/handbook/images/Why workload heavy.png" width="250">
  <p>CS2103/T prepares you for many higher-level project modules (CS3216/7, CS3201/2, CS3281/2/3/4, CG3002, etc.), each requiring a slightly different skill set. It is also the only SE course some of you do before going for industry internships. Therefore,
    we have to cover many essential SE concepts/skills and also provide enough exercises for you to practice those skills. This is also why we don't have time to go very deep into any of the topics.</p>
  <p>Remember, everything you learn here is going to be useful in a SE-related career.</p>
  <p>Also, consider this a gradual introduction to 'heavy' modules; most project modules you do after this are going to be much heavier :-p</p>
  <p><mark>How to reduce the workload?</mark> You can omit Learning Outcomes rated ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ They are counted for CS2103R and for A+ grades only.</p>

<h3 id="why-so-much-bean-counting">Why so much bean counting?</h3>
<div id="handbook-faq-beanCounting"><img src="/cs2103-website/handbook/images/small things matter.png" width="600" height="300">
  <p>Sometimes, small things matter in big ways. e.g., all other things being equal, a job may be offered to the candidate who has the neater looking CV although both have the same qualifications. This may be unfair, but that's how the world works. Students
    forget this harsh reality when they are in the protected environment of the school and tend to get sloppy with their work habits. That is why we reward all positive behavior, even small ones (e.g., following precise submission instructions, arriving
    on time etc.).</p>
  <p>But unlike the real world, we are forgiving. That is why you can still earn full 10 marks of the participation marks even if you miss a few things here and there.</p>

<h3 id="why-you-force-me-to-visit-a-separate-website-instead-of-using-ivle">Why you force me to visit a separate website instead of using IVLE?</h3>
<div id="handbook-faq-separateWebsite"><img src="/cs2103-website/handbook/images/Forces me to visit a separate website.png" width="655" height="271">
  <p>We have a separate website because some of the module information does not fit into the structure imposed by IVLE.</p>
  <p>On a related note, keep in mind that 'hunting and gathering' of relevant information is one of the skills you need to survive 'in the wild'. Do not always expect all relevant materials to appear 'magically' in some kind of 'work bin'.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, unlike IVLE, a copy of the module website <mark>will remain online</mark> at <a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs2103/AY1617S2/">http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs2103/AY1617S2/</a> for your reference for the next few years.</p>

<h3 id="why-slides-are-not-detailed">Why slides are not detailed?</h3>
<div id="handbook-faq-slideFormat"><img src="/cs2103-website/handbook/images/slides not detailed enough.png" width="733" height="221">
  <p>Slides are not meant to be documents to print and study for exams. Their purpose is to support the lecture delivery and keep you engaged during the lecture. That's why our slides are less detailed and more visual.</p>

<h3 id="why-so-much-self-study">Why so much self-study?</h3>
<div id="handbook-faq-selfStudy"><img src="/cs2103-website/handbook/images/so much self study.png" width="763" height="307">
  <p>Self-study is a critical survival skill in SE industry. Lectures will show you the way, but absorbing content is to be done at your own pace, by yourself. In this module, we still tell you what content to study and also pass most of the content to you.
    After you graduate, you have to decide what to study and find your own content too.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="what-if-i-dont-carry-around-a-laptop">What if I don't carry around a laptop?</h3>
<div id="handbook-faq-noLaptop">
  <p>If you do not have a laptop or prefer not to bring the laptop, it is up to you to show your work to the tutor in some way (e.g. by connecting to your home PC remotely), <em>without</em> requiring extra time/effort from the tutor or team members.</p>
  <p>Reason: As you enjoy the benefits of not bring the laptop; you (not others) should bear the cost too.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="why-very-narrow-project-scope">Why very narrow project scope?</h3>
<div id="handbook-faq-narrowScope">
  <p>Defining your own unique project is more fun.</p>
  <p>But, wider scope → more diverse projects → harder for us to go deep into your project. The collective know-how we (i.e., students and the teaching team) have built up about SE issues related to the project become shallow and stretched too thinly. It
    also affects fairness of grading.</p><img src="/cs2103-website/handbook/images/limited project scope.png" width="772" height="296">
  <p>That is why a strictly-defined project is more suitable for a first course in SE that focuses on nuts-and-bolts of SE. After learning those fundamentals, in higher level project modules you can focus more on the creative side of software projects without
    being dragged down by nuts-and-bolts SE issues (because you already know how to deal with them). However, we would like to allow some room for creativity too. That is why we let you build products that are slight variations of a given theme.</p>
  <p>Also note: The freedom to do 'anything' is not a necessary condition for creativity. Do not mistake being different for being creative. In fact, the more constrained you are, the more you need creativity to stand out.</p>

<h3 id="why-project-requirements-are-so-vague">Why project requirements are so vague?</h3>
<div id="handbook-faq-vagueRequirements"><img src="/cs2103-website/handbook/images/vague requirement.png" width="737" height="210">
  <p>&quot;You tell me exactly what to do - I do that - you pay me (in grades)&quot; is a model for contract work, not for learning. Being able to survive in imprecise, uncertain, volatile problem contexts is precisely what we are trying to teach you.</p>
  <p>For example, the best way to communicate something often depends on what is being communicated. That is why we don't specify the precise content for project documents. Instead, we aim to refine project documents iteratively. We believe the learning
    experience will be richer if we let you decide the best way to present your project information rather than just following our instructions blindly. For example, in real-life projects you are rarely told which diagrams to draw; that is a decision
    you have to make yourself.</p>

<h3 id="why-im-not-allowed-to-use-my-favorite-toolframeworklanguage-etc">Why I'm not allowed to use my favorite tool/framework/language etc.?</h3>
<div id="handbook-faq-favoriteTool"><img src="/cs2103-website/handbook/images/I'm not allowed to use my favorite tool.png" width="750" height="287">
  <p>We have chosen a basic set of tools after considering ease of learning, availability, typical-ness, popularity, migration path to other tools, etc. There are many reasons for limiting your choices:</p>
  <p>Pedagogical reasons:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We sometimes use 'good enough', not necessarily the best, tools: Most bleeding edge, most specialized, or most sophisticated tools are not suitable for a beginner course. After mastering our toolset, you will find it easy to upgrade to such high-end
      tools by yourself. We do expect you to eventually (after this module) migrate to better tools and, having learned more than one tool, to attain a more general understanding about a family of tools.</li>
    <li>Learn to thrive under given conditions: As a professional Software Engineer, you must learn to be productive in any given tool environment, rather than insist on using your preferred tools. It is usually in small companies doing less important work
      that you get to chose your own toolset. Bigger companies working on mature products often impose some choices on developers, such as the project management tool, code repository, IDE, language etc. For example, Google used SVN as their revision
      control software until very recently, long after SVN fell out of popularity among developers. Sometimes this is due to cost reasons (tool licensing cost), and sometimes due to legacy reasons (because the tool is already entrenched in their code
      base).<br> While programming in school is often a solo sport, programming in the industry is a team sport. As we are training you to become professional software engineers, it is important to get over the psychological hurdle of needing to satisfy
      individual preferences and get used to making the best of a given environment.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Practical reasons:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Some of the learning activities are tightly coupled to tools. Allowing more tools means tutors need to learn more tools, which increases their workload.</li>
    <li>We provide learning resources for tools. e.g. 'Git guides'. Allowing more tools means we need to produce more resources.</li>
    <li>When all students use the same tool, the collective expertise of the tool is more, increasing the opportunities for you to learn from each others.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Meanwhile, feel free to share with peers your experience of using other tools.</p>

<h3 id="why-so-many-submissions">Why so many submissions?</h3>
<div id="handbook-faq-manySubmissions"><img src="/cs2103-website/handbook/images/frequent submissions.png" width="759" height="359">
  <p>The high number of submissions is not meant to increase workload but to spread it across the semester. Learning theory and applying them should be done in parallel to maximize the learning effect. That can happen only if we spread theory and 'application
    of theory' (i.e., project work) evenly across the semester.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="why-not-enough-marks-for-intermediate-submissions">Why not enough marks for intermediate submissions?</h3>
<div id="handbook-faq-intermediateMarks"><img src="/cs2103-website/handbook/images/no marks for intermediate submissions.png" width="688" height="102">
  <p>Intermediate submissions are also incremental submissions. Intermediate submissions are included in the final submission too and will earn marks at that point. They are there to help you do well in the final submission and for us to monitor your progress
    and guide you accordingly. They are a means to an end. They are not achievements themselves. By right, they shouldn't be given marks at all. 😝</p>
</div>
<h3 id="why-submission-requirements-differ-between-cs2103t-and-cs2101">Why submission requirements differ between CS2103T and CS2101?</h3>
<div id="handbook-faq-cs2101Differences"><img src="/cs2103-website/handbook/images/Submission requirements differ.png" width="300">
  <p>They do, and they should.</p>
  <p>CS2103T communication requirements are limited to a very narrow scope (i.e., communicate about the product to users and developers). CS2101 aims to teach you technical communication in a much wider context. While you may be able to reuse some of the
    stuff across the two modules, submissions are not intended to be exactly the same.</p>
