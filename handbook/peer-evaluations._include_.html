<p>We use the <a href="http://teammatesv4.appspot.com/">TEAMMATES</a> online peer evaluation system to conduct several rounds of peer-evaluations. All peer evaluations will be taken into account when determining your participation marks. The system also
  allows you to give anonymous feedback to your teammates.</p>

<span id="giving-peer-feedback"><p>Giving constructive feedback to others is a valuable skill for software engineers. It is also an intended learning outcome of this module. <mark>Those who give ineffective feedback will be penalized.</mark></p><p>Here are some things to keep in mind:</p><ul><li>Assume you are giving feedback to a colleague, not a friend. Keep the tone of your feedback reasonably professional. Do not use offensive language or slang.</li><li>The feedback should be honest and consistent. Giving positive qualitative feedback (e.g. <code>Thanks for all the hard work!</code> and negative ratings (e.g. <code>Equal share - 40%</code>) to the same team member is not being honest.</li><li>State your expectations early. All too often students give positive/neutral feedback early (hoping that the team member will improve later) and trash the team member in the final evaluation (because the he/she did not improve as expected). However, this could be confusing to the recipient. It is better to give negative feedback early so that the team member gets a clear signal that he/she needs to improve.</li></ul></span>sThe final peer evaluation will be used to determine the level of contribution from each member to the project. In that peer-evaluation you will be asked to ==estimate the contribution of each team member== (including yourself) to the project so far.
