    <div>
      <p><strong>Where is everything?</strong> CS2103/T-related information are mainly in one of these two places:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <strong><a href="../schedule/index.html">Schedule page</a></strong> (organized chronologically): That is the one page you need to refer weekly.</li>
        <li><strong>Module handbook</strong> (i.e. this page. organized by topic) This is a reference document supplementary to the schedule page. This page contains a lot of text, probably too much to read in one sitting. Instead, <mark>skim through it quickly to learn what it contains.</mark>          You can come back to read details as-and-when the need arises. The schedule page lists relevant sections of the Handbook you should read at various points.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>CS2103 Vs CS2103T</strong>: Same lectures, same exam. Separate tutorials, separate project grading. Unless specified otherwise, whatever is stated for one module applies to the other.</p>
    </div>

  <h1 id="learning-outcomes">Learning Outcomes</h1>
  <div id="handbook-learning-outcomes">
    <div>
      <p>This module is organized primarily around a list of Learning Outcomes.</p>
      <p>Each week has a suggested list of LOs. They are categorized using using the following star-rating system:</p>

  <h1 id="lectures">Lectures</h1>
  <div id="handbook-lectures">
    <div><img src="/cs2103-website/handbook/images/Lecture photo.png" style="width: 713px;">
      <p><strong>Timing/venue</strong>: Fri 1400-1600 ICube Auditorium. Lectures start at 1400 sharp and end around 1545 (15 minutes to travel to next lecture).</p>
      <p>Each lecture consists of two sections:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>First half: <em>Flipped classroom</em> format. Discusses the learning outcomes of the current week.</li>
        <li>Second half: A preview of the learning outcomes for the following week.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Attendance</strong>: Attendance for the <mark>first lecture is compulsory</mark>.</p>
      <p><strong>Webcast</strong>: All lectures will be webcast. However, some things are not captured well in the webcast recording. You are advised to treat the webcast as a 'backup' for you to catch up anything missed during the lecture.</p>
      <p><strong>Handouts</strong>: All learning materials are organized around learning outcomes (not lectures or topics), are given in Web format, and can be found in the <a href="../book/index.html">Textbook</a> section and are also hyperlinked from the
        <a href="../schedule/index.html">Schedule Page</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>Slides</strong>: Our lecture slides are not suited for printing or using as a reference during the lecture/exams. Tey are only an aid for lecture delivery. Slides will be uploaded <em>after</em> the lecture.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h1 id="tutorials">Tutorials</h1>
  <div id="handbook-tutorials">
    <div>
      <p><mark>IMPORTANT: Our tutorials start on week 2 (even before CORS tutorial bidding is over), not in week 3 as other modules do. CS2103 (not CS2103T) students need to choose a temporary tutorial slot for week 2 tutorial. We'll inform you the procedure to do so in due course.</mark></p>
      <p><strong>What happens during the tutorial</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A tutorial has two tutors. Each tutor will work with two teams.</li>
        <li>The tutor will direct students to share/discuss evidence of achieving the learning outcomes (LO) allocated to the week.</li>
        <li>If some students have met with difficulties while achieving an LO, the tutor can direct those students to get help from those who have achieved the LO. <mark>The number of LOs that can be covered in the tutorial session depends on how well-prepared you are.</mark></li>
        <li>The tutor will observe, and give feedback on, how well you are achieving required LOs.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>The role of our tutors</strong> is different from tutors in other modules.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>No direct tech help</strong>: Tutors are prohibited from giving technical help, because we want you to learn the vital survival skill of troubleshooting technical problems.<br><span class="dimmed">[cf Appendix D: How to get tech help]</span></li>
        <li><strong>No ‘teaching’</strong>: Tutors are prohibited from “teaching” concepts that are covered in lectures or handouts. Self-learning is a vital part of the module. But tutors may help you clarify doubts. For example consider these two questions
          you might want to ask a tutor:
          <ul>
            <li><em>This is how I understood/applied coupling. Is that correct?</em> - Such questions are welcome.<br><strong>Reason</strong>:This question shows you have put in some effort to learn the topic and seeking further clarification from the tutor.</li>
            <li><em>What is coupling?</em> - Such questions will not be entertained.<br><strong>Reason</strong>: This question implies you haven’t done what you could to learn the topic in concern.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>No leading from the front</strong>: Tutors are not expected to lead your project effort. They will not tell you how to do project tasks or when to do project tasks. You have to figure those out yourselves. But tutors will give you feedback
          on how you are doing (or have done) project tasks so that you can improve further.<br><span class="dimmed">[Cf external resource: <a href="">A practitioner article about receiving feedback</a>]</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Timing/venue:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Please refer to the Schedule page for further details on each tutorial.</li>
        <li>You are expected to arrive on time.
          <ul>
            <li>If your tutorial is in <strong>COM1-B103</strong>: If you arrive early, you may enter the tutorial room by the door near the staircase and wait in the empty area of the room until the current class vacates the room.</li>
            <li>If your tutorial is in <strong>SR5</strong> or <strong>SR10</strong>: If you arrive early, please wait outside the room until you are asked to come in.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>You may leave the class 15 minutes before the hour if you have another class right after. There is no need to wait till the tutor dismisses you. However, inform the tutor (as a courtesy) before leaving if you leave before the class is dismissed.</li>
        <li>Please make sure you <mark>vacate the table 5 minutes before the hour</mark> so that the next group can start on time.</li>
        <li>In the past many students have suggested to increase the tutorial duration because 1 hour is barely enough to get through all the tutorial tasks. Increasing the tutorial time is not possible due to lack of venues and tutors. Instead, let's try
          to make the best of the one hour available by coming well prepared and starting on time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Grading:</strong></p>
      <p>Tutorials are not graded. However, your conduct will be reviewed by team members and the tutor which will determine your participation marks.</p>
      <p><strong>Other expectations:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Please bring your laptop to tutorials.</strong> You often need it to show your learning activity results. At other times, we ask you to work on project related things with your team members, which too may require the laptop. <span class="dimmed">Cf FAQ: <a href="">What if I don't carry a laptop around?</a></span></li>

        That is, the GUI is used to give visual feedback rather than to collect input. Some minimal use of mouse is OK (e.g. to click the minimize button), but the primary input should be CLI-driven. Mouse actions should have keyboard alternatives and

      <p>Your project should comply with the following constraints.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Constraint-Morph</strong>: The final product should be a result of morphing the given sample code. i.e. enhance and/or evolve the given code to arrive at the new software. However, you are allowed to replace all existing code with new
            code, as long as it is done incrementally. <span class="dimmed">e.g. one feature/component at a time</span><br><span class="dimmed"><strong>Reason:</strong> To ensure your code has a decent quality level from the start.</span></p>

            of mouse is OK (e.g. to click the minimize button), but the primary input should be command-driven. Mouse actions should have keyboard alternatives and typing is preferred over key combinations. Design the app in a way that you can do stuff

        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Constraint-No-Installer</strong>: The software should work without requiring an installer.

      <h4 id="step-1-brainstorm-user-stories">Step 1 : Brainstorm user stories</h4><img src="/cs2103-website/handbook/images/v00.png" width="250px">
      <p>Get together with your team members and brainstorm user stories <strong>for the v2.0 of the product</strong>. Note that in the project you will deliver only up to v1.5 but here you should consider up to v2.0 (i.e. beyond the module).</p>
      <panel header="%%User Story examples (from a different product)%%">
        <p><code>As a user I can add a task by specifying a task description only, so that I can record tasks that need to be done ‘some day’.</code><br><code>As a user I can find upcoming tasks, so that I can decide what needs to be done soon.</code><br><code>As a user I can delete a task, so that I can get rid of tasks that I no longer care to track.</code><br><code>As a new user I can view more information about a particular command, so that I can learn how to use various commands.</code><br><code>As an advanced user I can use shorter versions of a command, so that type a command faster.</code></p>
      </panel>
      <ul>
        <li>It is ok to have more user stories than you can deliver in the project.You should have at least 30 user stories. Include all 'obvious' ones you can think of but also look for 'non obvious' ones that you think are likely to be missed by other teams.</li>
        <li>Write each use story in a piece of paper (e.g. yellow sticky note, index card, or just pieces of paper about the size of a playing card). Alternatively you can use an online tool such as Trello for recording the initial collection of user stories.</li>
        <li>Note that <mark>you should not 'evaluate' the value of user stories while doing the above</mark>. An important aspect of brainstorming is not judging the ideas generated.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="step-2-prioritize-the-user-stories">Step 2: Prioritize the user stories</h4><img src="/cs2103-website/handbook/images/userstories.png" width="250px">
      <p>Suggested workflow:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Take one use story at a time and get team member opinions about it.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Based on the team consensus, put the story (i.e. the piece of paper) onto one of these three piles:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>Must-Have</code> : The product will be practically useless without this feature.</li>
            <li><code>Nice-To-Have</code> : The target user can benefit from this user story significantly but you are not certain if you'll have time to implement it.</li>
            <li><code>Not-Useful</code> : No significant benefit to the target use.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>After all stories have been put in the above three piles, you can make a record of which stories are in the three piles.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Here are some tips to improve the effectiveness of the above activity:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Define the target user:</strong><br> Decide our target user's profile (e.g. a student, office worker, programmer, sales person) and work patterns (e.g. Does he work in groups or alone? Does he share his computer with others?). A clear
          understanding of the target user will help when deciding the importance of a user story.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't be biased by the implementation plans:</strong><br> This exercise is for identifying user needs. Clear your mind of ideas you have about what your end product will look like.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't discuss implementation details or whether you are actually going to implement it:</strong><br> At this point, your decision is whether the user's need is important enough for you to want to fulfil it. Implementation details can be
          discussed later. If a user story in the Nice-To-Have pile turn out to be too difficult to implement later, you can always not implement it.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't be too hasty to discard 'unusual' user stories:</strong><br> Those might make your product unique and stand out from the rest, at least for some potential users.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't go into too much details when sorting user stories:</strong><br> For example, consider this user story:
          <ul>
            <li><code>As a user, I want to see a list of tasks that needs my attention most at the present time, so that I pay attention to them first.</code><br> When discussing this user story, you do not need to worry about what tasks should be considered
              'needs my attention most at the present time'. Those details can be worked out later.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="step-3-record-v20-requirements-in-the-developer-guide">Step 3: Record v2.0 Requirements in the Developer Guide</h4>
      <p>Based on your user story categorization in step 1, given project requirements, and the current state of the product, select which user stories you are likely to include in v2.0.</p>
      <p>Update the following pages of the Developer Guide:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>User Stories</strong>: Give a list of the user stories, including priorities. This can include user stories considered but will not be included in the final product.</li>
        <li><strong>Use cases</strong>: Give use cases (textual form) for a few representative user stories that need multiple steps to complete. e.g.
          <ul>
            <li>Adding a tag to a person (assume the user needs to find the person first).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Non-functional requirements</strong>:<br> Note: Many of the project constraints mentioned above are NFRs. You can add more. e.g. performance requirements, usability requirements, scalability requirements, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Glossary</strong>: Define terms that are worth defining.</li>
        <li><strong>Product survey</strong> [Optional]: Explore a few similar/related products and describe your findings i.e. Pros, cons, (from the target user's point of view).</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Suggested length</strong>: Follow the existing user guide and developer guides in terms of the level of details.</p>
      <p><strong>Submission</strong>: Update the relevant sections of the relevant asciidoc documents in your repo.</p>
      <p><strong>Grading</strong>: Reaching this milestone (and future milestones) will be counted under 'Project management' component of the final project grade.<br> To claim this milestone as 'reached', you should at least have a full draft version of
        the above documents in some format (e.g. GoogleDoc), even if you did not have time to update the markdown documents in the repo.</p>
      <h3 id="v10-product">v1.0 Product</h3>
      <p><strong>Objective</strong>: To familiarize yourself with the code.</p>
      <p><strong>Description</strong>: Divide the component among yourselves. Each member can do some small enhancements to the component they are in charge of to learn the code of that component. Some suggested enhancements are given in the AddressBook-Level4
        developer guide.</p>
      <p><strong>Submission</strong>: Create PRs from your own fork to your team repo.</p>
      <p><strong>Grading</strong>: This is an individual milestone. Considered reached if you have at least attempted to enhance the code of a component, even if you did not fully succeed.</p>

            <p>Mark your code with a <code>//@@author matric-number</code>. Note the double <code>@</code>. The comment syntax may vary based on file type e.g. for markdown, fxml, html</p>
            <pre class="hljs"><code>&lt;!-- @@author matric-number --&gt;
</code></pre>
            <p>Here is a sample code file:</p>
            <pre class="hljs"><code>//@@author A0909865T
method 1 ...
method 2 ...
//@@author A0702345U
method 3 ...
//@@author A0909865X
method 4 ...
</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The <code>//@@author</code> tag should appear only at the beginning of the code a person wrote. The code up to the next <code>//@@author</code> tag or the end of the file (whichever comes first) will be considered as was written by that author.<br>              However, you may put an empty <code>//@@author</code> (i.e. no matric number) to indicate the end of the code segment you wrote, if you don't know who wrote the code segment below yours. The author of that code segment can add the matric
              number to the empty tag later.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>If a method was written by more than one person, the <code>//@@author</code> tag should indicate the person who wrote most of that method. i.e., <code>//@@author</code> tag should not appear inside a method.<br> If some part of the code was
              done collectively, you should still divide it up to reflect the amount of work each person contributed. For example, if 3 people wrote 150 lines of code and put in equal effort in doing so, you can divide the methods among yourselves roughly
              50 lines to each person. Once a code segment is allocated to one person, that person is responsible (and will be graded for) the quality of that code. If parts of that code was written by someone else and those parts are not of high quality,
              the designated author should refactor the code to make it high quality.<br> Tip: GitHub has a 'blame' feature and a 'history' feature that can help you determine who wrote a piece of code.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Do not put the <code>//@@author</code> inside java header comments as only the content below that tag will be collated.</p>

              means such as duplicating the same code in multiple places. In particular, do not copy-paste test cases to create redundant tests. Even repetitive code blocks within test methods should be extracted out as utility methods to reduce code
              duplication.<br> Individual members are responsible for making sure their own collated files contain the correct content.<br> If you notice a team member claiming credit for code that he/she did not write, you can email us (after the final

                <p><strong>INCLUDE</strong>: everything that required significant ‘writing’ effort. e.g. comments, test code, styling (e.g. css), xml, even test data files. But do not include chunks of text that were trivially copy pasted e.g. a test data
                  file with 1000 tasks that was used to test performance.</p>
              </li>

        <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Strictly no more than 3 minutes per person (i.e. a total of 12 minutes for a 4-person team). Exceeding this limit will be penalized.</li>
        <li><strong>Schedule:</strong> Your demo timing is same as your tutorial time in week 13.<br> Starting times: <code>Team B1: 00 minutes, B2: 15 minutes, B3: 30 minutes, B4: 45 minutes</code><br> At least some team members need to arrive 15 minutes
          ahead of the allocated time to set up your computer.<br> There is an <mark>automatic penalty if you are not ready to start on time.</mark>.</li>
        <li><strong>Target audience</strong>: Assume you are giving a demo to a higher-level manager of your company, to brief him/her on the current capabilities of the product.</li>
        <li><strong>Scope</strong>:
          <ul>
            <li>Organize the demo to present a cohesive picture of the product as a whole. Unlike in v1.4-v1.5rc demos, there is no need for each person to demo their own features.</li>
            <li>Remember to explain the profile of the target user early in the demo.</li>
            <li>The scenarios you demonstrate should be chosen judiciously so that you cover the full range of your product's functionality. Give more time to stronger features (i.e. cover mundane/basic features fast). It is recommended you showcase how the
              product improves the user’s life rather than simply describe each feature.</li>
            <li>No need to cover design/implementation details as the manager is not interested in those details. Remember to</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Dress code</strong> : The level of formality is up to you, but it is recommended that the whole team dress at the same level.</li>
        <li><strong>Testing:</strong> All team member should remain in the holding area during the tutorial slot (when you are not doing the demo) because our testers might need to communicate with you during the testing.<br> Holding area for Active Learning
          Room: Unused area of the room (enter by the door near the staircase)<br> Holding area for SR5 and SR10: corridor outside the venue</li>
        <li><strong>Structure:</strong><br> Demo the product using the same executable you submitted, on your own laptop, using the TV.<br> Every team member should take part in the demo. However, it's ok for one member to do all the typing.</li>
        <li><strong>Optimizing the time:</strong><br> Try to make the maximum use of the short demo time in the following ways,
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Spend as much time as possible on demonstrating the actual product. Not recommended to use slides (if you do, use them sparingly) or videos or lengthy narrations.<br> Avoid skits, re-enactments, dramatizations etc. This is not a sales pitch
                or an informercial. While you need to show how a user use the product to get value, but you don’t need to act like an imaginary user. For example, [Instead of this]<code>Jim get’s a call from boss. &quot;Ring ring&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;oh hi Jim, can we postpone the meeting?&quot; &quot;Sure&quot;. Jim hang up and curses the boss under his breath. Now he starts typing ..etc.</code><br>                [do this] <code>If Jim needs to postpone the meeting, he can type …</code><br> It’s not that dramatization is bad or we don’t like it. We simply don’t have enough time for it.<br> Note that CS2101 demo requirements may differ. Different
                context → Different requirements.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Rehearse the steps well and ensure you can do a smooth demo. <mark>Demos that are clearly under-prepared will be penalized.</mark></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>If you are not deft with using the laptop’s touchpad, please bring a mouse.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Don’t waste time repeating things the target audience already knows. e.g. no need to say things like &quot;We are students from NUS, SoC&quot;.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Bring sufficient amount of sample data and know how to load them to the system. You should not plan to type all the sample data during the demo itself. On the other hand, trying to demo a product using just a couple of sample tasks creates
                a bad impression too.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Plan the demo to be in sync with the impression you want to create. For example, if you are trying to convince that the product is easy to use, show the easiest way to enter a task before you show the full command with all the bells and
                whistles.</p>

  <div id="handbook-project-assessment">
    <div>
      <p>Note that project grading is <mark>not competitive (not bell curved)</mark>. <mark>CS2103T projects will be assessed separately from CS2103 projects.</mark> This is to account for the perceived difference in workload. Given below is the marking
        scheme.</p>
      <p><strong>Total</strong>: 50 marks (40 individual marks + 10 team marks)</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Product features</strong> [team][5 marks] - How good is your software as a product?</p>
          <p>Based on the features implemented, how well they fit together to make a good product, and how well they are demonstrated.</p>
          <p>‘Half-baked’ (i.e. not production quality) or 'ill-fitting' (feature does not go well with the other features) features will not earn marks at all and could even be penalized. It may be better to remove such features before submission.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Implementation</strong> [individual][20 marks] - How good is your implementation? A measure of the <mark>quality and the quantity</mark> of code you have written yourself. Evaluated based on an inspection of the collated code (submitted
            in your <code>/collated/*.md</code> files).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>QA</strong> [individual][10 marks] - How good is your Quality Assurance? Evaluated based on your test code and our own manual testing.</p>
          <p>Expectations:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>There is no requirement for a minimum coverage level. Note that in a production environment you are often required to have at least 90% of the code covered by tests. In this project, it can be less.</li>
            <li>How much of each type of testing should you do? We expect you to decide. You learned different types of testing and what they try to achieve. Based on that, you should decide how much of each type is required. Similarly, you can decide to
              what extent you want to automate tests, depending on the benefits and the effort required.</li>
            <li>Applying TDD is optional. If you plan to test something, it is better to apply TDD because TDD ensures that you write functional code in a testable way. If you do it the normal way, you often find that it is hard to test the functional code
              because the code has low testability.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Documentation</strong> [individual][10 marks] - How well does your user guide achieves its objectives? Evaluated based on the relevant sections of your project portfolio.<br> Criteria considered:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Explanation should be clear and written to match the audience.</li>
            <li>Good use of visuals to complement text.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Project management</strong> [team: 5 marks] - How well you worked together as a team to follow a systematic process? Evaluated based on Github data and supervisor observations.<br> Criteria:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Good use of GitHub milestones.</li>
            <li>Good use of GitHub release mechanism.</li>
            <li>Good version control, based on the repo.</li>
            <li>Reasonable attempt to use the forking workflow.</li>
            <li>Good task definition, assignment and tracking, based on the issue tracker.</li>
            <li>Good use of buffers (opposite: everything at the last minute)</li>
            <li>Iterative (opposite: fake iterative, doing most of the work in one iteration).</li>
            <li>Passed almost all checkpoints from v1.0 to v1.5</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

      <ul>
        <li>Week 1 - 5: Phase A team</li>
        <li>Week 6 - 13: Phase B team (i.e. Project team)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Phase A (Weeks 1 - 5) is the period for strengthening individual competencies. By working with different classmates during this period you get to know and learn from more classmates. The project is done in phase B. That means your Phase B team is
        also your project team.</p>
      <p><mark>There cannot be any overlap between your 2 teams</mark>. For example, any member from your Phase A team cannot be a member of your Phase B team.</p>
      <p><strong>When to form teams</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>CS2103T: Your phase A team will be formed by CS2101 side in week 1. Your phase B team (applicable to CS2101 too) will be formed by CS2103T side on week 5.</li>
        <li>CS2103: Form tentative Phase A teams in week 2 (during the tutorial). Finalize phase A team in the subsequent tutorial. Form phase B team on week 5.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Team size</strong>: The default <mark>team size is four</mark>. Please do not form teams with five or more.</p>
      <p><strong>Team ID</strong>: This will be given to you after forming teams in each phase. It has the form <code>TUTORIAL_ID-PHASE+TEAM_NUMBER</code> e.g, <code>W14-A2</code> means you are in tutorial W14 (i.e., Wed 1400-1500), phase A, team 2.</p>
      <p><strong>Team composition</strong></p>
      <p>We allow some freedom in choosing team members, subject to these constraints:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>All team members should be in the same tutorial. <mark>Delay forming teams until your place in a tutorial is confirmed.</mark> We do not allow changing tutorials to team up with your preferred team mates.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Teams of <mark>single nationality are not allowed</mark> (rationale: to train you to work in multicultural teams). However, we allow same nationality teams if the only language common among all team members is English. e.g. an all-Singaporean
            team that include both Chinese and Malay students.</p>
        </li>
        <li>

        <p>Giving constructive feedback to others is a valuable skill for software engineers. It is also an intended learning outcome of this module. <mark>Those who give ineffective feedback will be penalized.</mark></p>
        <p>Here are some things to keep in mind:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Assume you are giving feedback to a colleague, not a friend. Keep the tone of your feedback reasonably professional. Do not use offensive language or slang.</li>
          <li>The feedback should be honest and consistent. Giving positive qualitative feedback (e.g. <code>Thanks for all the hard work!</code> and negative ratings (e.g. <code>Equal share - 40%</code>) to the same team member is not being honest.</li>
          <li>State your expectations early. All too often students give positive/neutral feedback early (hoping that the team member will improve later) and trash the team member in the final evaluation (because the he/she did not improve as expected). However,
            this could be confusing to the recipient. It is better to give negative feedback early so that the team member gets a clear signal that he/she needs to improve.</li>
        </ul>
        </span>
        sThe final peer evaluation will be used to determine the level of contribution from each member to the project. In that peer-evaluation you will be asked to ==estimate the contribution of each team member== (including yourself) to the project so far.

      <p><strong>Communication</strong>: Keeping a record of communications among your team can help you, and us, in many ways. We encourage you to do at least some of the project communication in written medium (e.g., GitHub Issue Tracker) to practice how
        to communicate technical things in written form.</p>
      <p><strong>Collaboration platform</strong>: You are <mark><em>required to</em> use GitHub</mark> as the hosting and collaboration platform of your project (i.e., to hold the Code repository, Issue Tracker, etc.). See <a href="#handbook-appendixE-github">Appendix E</a>        for more info on how to setup and use GitHub for your project.</p>
      <p><strong>IDE</strong>: You are recommended to use <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">Intellij IDEA</a> for module-related programming work. You may use the community edition (free) or the ultimate edition (free for students). While the use
        of Intellij is not compulsory, note that module materials are optimized for Intellij. Use other IDEs at your own risk.</p>
      <p><strong>Revision control</strong>: You are <mark><em>required to</em> use Git</mark>. Other revision control software are not allowed.<br> The recommended GUI client for Git is <a href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/">SourceTree</a> (which comes
        bundled with Git), but you may use any other, or none.</p>

          <p>Note that project grading is <mark>not competitive (not bell curved)</mark>. <mark>CS2103T projects will be assessed separately from CS2103 projects.</mark> This is to account for the perceived difference in workload. Given below is the marking
            scheme.</p>
          <p><strong>Total</strong>: 50 marks (40 individual marks + 10 team marks)</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Product features</strong> [team][5 marks] - How good is your software as a product?</p>
              <p>Based on the features implemented, how well they fit together to make a good product, and how well they are demonstrated.</p>
              <p>‘Half-baked’ (i.e. not production quality) or 'ill-fitting' (feature does not go well with the other features) features will not earn marks at all and could even be penalized. It may be better to remove such features before submission.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Implementation</strong> [individual][20 marks] - How good is your implementation? A measure of the <mark>quality and the quantity</mark> of code you have written yourself. Evaluated based on an inspection of the collated code (submitted
                in your <code>/collated/*.md</code> files).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>QA</strong> [individual][10 marks] - How good is your Quality Assurance? Evaluated based on your test code and our own manual testing.</p>
              <p>Expectations:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>There is no requirement for a minimum coverage level. Note that in a production environment you are often required to have at least 90% of the code covered by tests. In this project, it can be less.</li>
                <li>How much of each type of testing should you do? We expect you to decide. You learned different types of testing and what they try to achieve. Based on that, you should decide how much of each type is required. Similarly, you can decide
                  to what extent you want to automate tests, depending on the benefits and the effort required.</li>
                <li>Applying TDD is optional. If you plan to test something, it is better to apply TDD because TDD ensures that you write functional code in a testable way. If you do it the normal way, you often find that it is hard to test the functional
                  code because the code has low testability.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Documentation</strong> [individual][10 marks] - How well does your user guide achieves its objectives? Evaluated based on the relevant sections of your project portfolio.<br> Criteria considered:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Explanation should be clear and written to match the audience.</li>
                <li>Good use of visuals to complement text.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Project management</strong> [team: 5 marks] - How well you worked together as a team to follow a systematic process? Evaluated based on Github data and supervisor observations.<br> Criteria:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Good use of GitHub milestones.</li>
                <li>Good use of GitHub release mechanism.</li>
                <li>Good version control, based on the repo.</li>
                <li>Reasonable attempt to use the forking workflow.</li>
                <li>Good task definition, assignment and tracking, based on the issue tracker.</li>
                <li>Good use of buffers (opposite: everything at the last minute)</li>
                <li>Iterative (opposite: fake iterative, doing most of the work in one iteration).</li>

        The product is you, NOT what you build.

      <p>The software product you build is a side effect only. You are the product of this module. This means,</p>

        <li>Building a software product that is unique, creative, and shiny is not our priority (although we try to do a bit of that too). <strong>Learning to take pride in, and discovering the joy of, high quality software engineering work is our priority</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Following from that, we evaluate you on not just how much you've done, but also, how well you've done those things. Here are some of the aspects in which we focus on:</p>

      <p>In this module, last minute heroics will not earn you a good project grade, and last minute mugging will not earn you a good exam grade.</p>
      <p><strong>Where you reach at the end matters, NOT what you knew at the beginning.</strong></p>
      <p>When you start the module, some others in the class may appear to know a lot more than you. Don't let that worry you. The final grade depends on what you know at the end, not what you knew to begin with. All marks allocated to intermediate deliverables
        are within the reach of everyone in the class irrespective of their prior knowledge.</p>

        <p>When working with others, especially in a large class such as CS2103,  it is very important that you adhere to standards, policies, and instructions imposed on everyone. Not doing so creates unnecessary headaches for everyone and sends negative
          signals about your work attitude. That is why we penalize for not following instructions carefully.</p>

            saying anything back. Not responding to a personal email is just as bad. Always take a few seconds to at least acknowledge such emails.  It doesn't take long to type &quot;Noted. Thanks&quot; and hit 'send'.</p>
          <p>The promptness of a reply is even more important when the email is requesting you for something that you cannot provide. Imagine you wrote to the prof requesting a reference letter and the prof did not respond at all because he/she did not want
            to give you one; You'll be quite frustrated because you wouldn't know whether to look for another prof or wait longer for a response. Saying 'No' is fine and in fact a necessary part of professional life; but saying nothing is not acceptable.

            <p>In this module, we want to move you away from 'hand holding'. We want you to learn how to solve problems on your own. This is a vital survival skill in the industry and it needs practice.</p>
            <p>Whether it is a technical problem (e.g. error when using Eclipse) or a doubt about a concept (e.g. what is the difference between scripted testing and exploratory testing?) the teaching team is happy to work with you when you look for a solution/answer.
              But we do not do it for you. Do not fire off an ‘SOS’ email to the lecturer/tutor right away. We discourage unconditional direct help because we want you to learn to help yourself. Yes, we believe in ‘tough love’.</p>
            <p>The question you should always ask yourself is, 'how do I solve this problem if the lecturer/tutors are not around to help me?'</p><img src="/cs2103-website/handbook/images/the good reasons to get home early.png" width="300">
            <p>Note: This guide is mostly about getting tech help, but it also applies to getting clarifications on module topics too. e.g. what is the difference between <em>aaa</em> and <em>bbb</em>?</p>
            <p>What not to do: Email lecturer/tutor immediately after you encounter a problem or a doubt, unless it is something only the lecturer/tutor is supposed to know.</p>
            <p>When faced with a technical problem or a doubt about a concept, here are the things you should do:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Check what is given</strong>: Check if the problem/concept has been discussed in the lectures, text book, or the list of resources given to you. Yes it is easier for you to write an email to the tutor/lecturer instead, but that
                  shouldn't be your default behavior. We know that sometimes it is difficult to find stuff in handouts/handbook etc. But you should try first.</p>

              <li>
                <p><strong>Search</strong>: It is very likely the answer already exists somewhere in the cyberspace. Almost every programming-related question has been answered in places like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow</a>. Don't give
                  an opportunity for someone to ask you to <a href="http://www.jibble.org/stfw/">STFW</a>.<br> Pay attention to the error message you encounter. Sometimes it also contains hints as to how to fix the problem. Even if not, a <mark>web search on the error message</mark>
                  is a good starting point.  <br><img src="/cs2103-website/handbook/images/how to google it.png" width="460" height="268"></p>

                  <li>
                    <p>PLEASE search for existing answers before you post your question in those public forums; You don't want to appear as a 'clueless' or 'too lazy to do your research' person in a public forum.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Learn to isolate the problem. &quot;My code doesn't work&quot; isn't going to help even if you post the whole code online. Others don't have time to go through all of your code. Isolate the part that doesn't work and strip it down
                      to the bare minimum that is enough reproduce the error. Sometimes, this process actually helps you to figure out the problem yourself. If not, at least it increases the chance of someone else being able to help you.<br>
                      <tip-box type="tip">
                        How to isolate problematic code? Delete code (one bit at a time) that is confirmed as not related to the problem. Do that until you can still reproduce the problem with the least amount of code remaining.

                    <p>Generalize the problem. &quot;How to write tasks to a text file using Java&quot; is too specific to what you are working on. You are more likely to find help if you post a thread called (or search for) &quot;How to write to a file
                      using Java&quot;.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Explain well. Conversations via online forums take time. If you post everything that is relevant to your problem, you chances of getting an answer in the first try is higher. If others have to ask you more questions before they can
                      help you, it will take longer. But this doesn't mean you dump too much information into the thread either.<br>

          <li>You are not allowed to share project-related things with other teams directly.</li>

        <p>Detection:</p>
        <p>Detecting plagiarism in code is quite easy. You are not fooling anyone by reordering code or renaming methods/variables. Besides, all your submissions are published to the class and sooner or later somebody will notice the plagiarism.</p>
        <p>Penalties:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>For activities earning participation marks: We make a record of cases of plagiarism but we do not take further action. Because participation marks are given for effort and all students can earn the full marks easily, such plagiarism does not
            disadvantage other students. Therefore, we prefer to spend all available resources on helping honest students to do better rather than to chase after dishonest students. If you think you gain something by plagiarizing, go ahead and do it.
            It's your choice and it's your loss.</li>

        <p>CS2103/T prepares you for many higher-level project modules (CS3216/7, CS3201/2, CS3281/2/3/4, CG3002, etc.), each requiring a slightly different skill set. It is also the only SE course some of you do before going for industry internships. Therefore,
          we have to cover many essential SE concepts/skills and also provide enough exercises for you to practice those skills. This is also why we don't have time to go very deep into any of the topics.</p>

        <p>Sometimes, small things matter in big ways. e.g., all other things being equal, a job may be offered to the candidate who has the neater looking CV although both have the same qualifications. This may be unfair, but that's how the world works.
          Students forget this harsh reality when they are in the protected environment of the school and tend to get sloppy with their work habits. That is why we reward all positive behavior, even small ones (e.g., following precise submission instructions,
          arriving on time etc.).</p>
        <p>But unlike the real world, we are forgiving. That is why you can still earn full 10 marks of the participation marks even if you miss a few things here and there.</p>

      <div id="handbook-faq-narrowScope">
        <p>Defining your own unique project is more fun.</p>
        <p>But, wider scope → more diverse projects → harder for us to go deep into your project. The collective know-how we (i.e., students and the teaching team) have built up about SE issues related to the project become shallow and stretched too thinly.
          It also affects fairness of grading.</p><img src="/cs2103-website/handbook/images/limited project scope.png" width="772" height="296">
        <p>That is why a strictly-defined project is more suitable for a first course in SE that focuses on nuts-and-bolts of SE. After learning those fundamentals, in higher level project modules you can focus more on the creative side of software projects
          without being dragged down by nuts-and-bolts SE issues (because you already know how to deal with them). However, we would like to allow some room for creativity too. That is why we let you build products that are slight variations of a given
          theme.</p>
        <p>Also note: The freedom to do 'anything' is not a necessary condition for creativity. Do not mistake being different for being creative. In fact, the more constrained you are, the more you need creativity to stand out.</p>

        <p>&quot;You tell me exactly what to do - I do that - you pay me (in grades)&quot; is a model for contract work, not for learning. Being able to survive in imprecise, uncertain, volatile problem contexts is precisely what we are trying to teach you.</p>
        <p>For example, the best way to communicate something often depends on what is being communicated. That is why we don't specify the precise content for project documents. Instead, we aim to refine project documents iteratively. We believe the learning
          experience will be richer if we let you decide the best way to present your project information rather than just following our instructions blindly. For example, in real-life projects you are rarely told which diagrams to draw; that is a decision
          you have to make yourself.</p>

      <div id="handbook-faq-favoriteTool"><img src="/cs2103-website/handbook/images/I'm not allowed to use my favorite tool.png" width="750" height="287">
        <p>We have chosen a basic set of tools after considering ease of learning, availability, typical-ness, popularity, migration path to other tools, etc. There are many reasons for limiting your choices:</p>
        <p>Pedagogical reasons:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>We sometimes use 'good enough', not necessarily the best, tools: Most bleeding edge, most specialized, or most sophisticated tools are not suitable for a beginner course. After mastering our toolset, you will find it easy to upgrade to such
            high-end tools by yourself. We do expect you to eventually (after this module) migrate to better tools and, having learned more than one tool, to attain a more general understanding about a family of tools.</li>
          <li>Learn to thrive under given conditions: As a professional Software Engineer, you must learn to be productive in any given tool environment, rather than insist on using your preferred tools. It is usually in small companies doing less important
            work that you get to chose your own toolset. Bigger companies working on mature products often impose some choices on developers, such as the project management tool, code repository, IDE, language etc. For example, Google used SVN as their
            revision control software until very recently, long after SVN fell out of popularity among developers. Sometimes this is due to cost reasons (tool licensing cost), and sometimes due to legacy reasons (because the tool is already entrenched
            in their code base).<br> While programming in school is often a solo sport, programming in the industry is a team sport. As we are training you to become professional software engineers, it is important to get over the psychological hurdle
            of needing to satisfy individual preferences and get used to making the best of a given environment.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Practical reasons:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Some of the learning activities are tightly coupled to tools. Allowing more tools means tutors need to learn more tools, which increases their workload.</li>
          <li>We provide learning resources for tools. e.g. 'Git guides'. Allowing more tools means we need to produce more resources.</li>
          <li>When all students use the same tool, the collective expertise of the tool is more, increasing the opportunities for you to learn from each others.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Meanwhile, feel free to share with peers your experience of using other tools.</p>

      <div id="handbook-faq-manySubmissions"><img src="/cs2103-website/handbook/images/frequent submissions.png" width="759" height="359">
        <p>The high number of submissions is not meant to increase workload but to spread it across the semester. Learning theory and applying them should be done in parallel to maximize the learning effect. That can happen only if we spread theory and 'application
          of theory' (i.e., project work) evenly across the semester.</p>

        <p>Intermediate submissions are also incremental submissions. Intermediate submissions are included in the final submission too and will earn marks at that point. They are there to help you do well in the final submission and for us to monitor your
          progress and guide you accordingly. They are a means to an end. They are not achievements themselves. By right, they shouldn't be given marks at all. 😝</p>

        <p>They do, and they should.</p>
        <p>CS2103T communication requirements are limited to a very narrow scope (i.e., communicate about the product to users and developers). CS2101 aims to teach you technical communication in a much wider context. While you may be able to reuse some

      <p>In this module, we want to move you away from 'hand holding'. We want you to learn how to solve problems on your own. This is a vital survival skill in the industry and it needs practice.</p>
      <p>Whether it is a technical problem (e.g. error when using Eclipse) or a doubt about a concept (e.g. what is the difference between scripted testing and exploratory testing?) the teaching team is happy to work with you when you look for a solution/answer.
        But we do not do it for you. Do not fire off an ‘SOS’ email to the lecturer/tutor right away. We discourage unconditional direct help because we want you to learn to help yourself. Yes, we believe in ‘tough love’.</p>
      <p>The question you should always ask yourself is, 'how do I solve this problem if the lecturer/tutors are not around to help me?'</p><img src="/cs2103-website/handbook/images/the good reasons to get home early.png" width="300">
      <p>Note: This guide is mostly about getting tech help, but it also applies to getting clarifications on module topics too. e.g. what is the difference between <em>aaa</em> and <em>bbb</em>?</p>
      <p>What not to do: Email lecturer/tutor immediately after you encounter a problem or a doubt, unless it is something only the lecturer/tutor is supposed to know.</p>
      <p>When faced with a technical problem or a doubt about a concept, here are the things you should do:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Check what is given</strong>: Check if the problem/concept has been discussed in the lectures, text book, or the list of resources given to you. Yes it is easier for you to write an email to the tutor/lecturer instead, but that shouldn't
            be your default behavior. We know that sometimes it is difficult to find stuff in handouts/handbook etc. But you should try first.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Search</strong>: It is very likely the answer already exists somewhere in the cyberspace. Almost every programming-related question has been answered in places like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow</a>. Don't give an
            opportunity for someone to ask you to <a href="http://www.jibble.org/stfw/">STFW</a>.<br> Pay attention to the error message you encounter. Sometimes it also contains hints as to how to fix the problem. Even if not, a <mark>web search on the error message</mark>
            is a good starting point.  <br><img src="/cs2103-website/handbook/images/how to google it.png" width="460" height="268"></p>

          <p><strong>Ask peers</strong>:</p>
          <p>Ask your team members.</p>
          <p>Ask classmates using the IVLE forum. Asking questions in IVLE is encouraged. Even if you figured out one way to solve a problem, discussing it on IVLE might lead you to better ways of solving it, and will help other classmates who are facing
            similar problems too. If you are really shy to ask questions in IVLE, you may use  <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1vf2TjVhASq_u1_kQEEyURE5fTeBg6iKwGQDJUxYiAmg/viewform">this form</a>  to submit your question anonymously which we

            <p>Use Rubber Duck Debugging:</p>
            <p>Rubber duck debugging is an informal term used in software engineering to refer to a method of debugging code. The name is a reference to a story in the book The Pragmatic Programmer in which a programmer would carry around a rubber duck and
              debug his code by forcing himself to explain it, line-by-line, to the duck.</p>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Ask the world</strong> using programming forums such as stackoverflow.</p>
          <p>Here are some tips for posting help request:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>PLEASE search for existing answers before you post your question in those public forums; You don't want to appear as a 'clueless' or 'too lazy to do your research' person in a public forum.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Learn to isolate the problem. &quot;My code doesn't work&quot; isn't going to help even if you post the whole code online. Others don't have time to go through all of your code. Isolate the part that doesn't work and strip it down to the
                bare minimum that is enough reproduce the error. Sometimes, this process actually helps you to figure out the problem yourself. If not, at least it increases the chance of someone else being able to help you.<br>
                <tip-box type="tip">
                  How to isolate problematic code? Delete code (one bit at a time) that is confirmed as not related to the problem. Do that until you can still reproduce the problem with the least amount of code remaining.
                </tip-box>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Generalize the problem. &quot;How to write tasks to a text file using Java&quot; is too specific to what you are working on. You are more likely to find help if you post a thread called (or search for) &quot;How to write to a file using
                Java&quot;.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Explain well. Conversations via online forums take time. If you post everything that is relevant to your problem, you chances of getting an answer in the first try is higher. If others have to ask you more questions before they can help
                you, it will take longer. But this doesn't mean you dump too much information into the thread either.<br>

        <h2 id="project-schedule-tracking">Project Schedule Tracking</h2>
        <p>In general, use the issue tracker (Milestones, Issues, PRs, Tags, Releases, and Labels) for assigning, scheduling, and tracking <em>all</em> noteworthy project tasks, including user stories. Update the issue tracker regularly to reflect the current
          status of the project. You can also use GitHub's new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6MGKHkNtxU">Projects feature</a> to manage the project, but keep it linked to the issue tracker as much as you can.</p>
        <h3 id="using-issues">Using Issues:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Record each of the user stories you plan to deliver as an issue in the issue tracker. e.g. <code>Title: As a user I can add a deadline</code><br><code>Description: ... so that I can keep track of my deadlines</code></li>
          <li>Assign the <code>type.*</code> and <code>priority.*</code> labels to those issues.</li>
          <li>When you start implementing a story, break it down to tasks. Define reasonable sized, standalone tasks. A task should be able to done by one person, in a few hours. e.g. <br> Good: Update class diagram in the project manual for v1.5<br> Bad (reasons:
            not a one-person task, not small enough): Write the project manual</li>
          <li>Write a descriptive title for the issue. <br> e.g. Add support for the 'undo' command to the parser.</li>
          <li>There is no need to break things into VERY small tasks. Keep them as big as possible, but they should be no bigger than what you are going to assign a single person to do within a week. So the user story <code>Implementing parser</code>  is
            too big because it cannot be done by a single person in a week. However,<code>Implementing parser support for adding of floating tasks</code> is of appropriate size.</li>
          <li>Do not track things taken for granted. e.g., 'push code to repo' should not be a task to track. In the example given under the previous point, it is taken for granted that the owner will also (a) test the code and (b) push to the repo when it
            is ready. Those two need not be tracked as separate tasks.</li>
          <li>Omit unnecessary details. In some cases, the summary/title is enough to describe the task. In that case, no need to repeat it in the description. There is no need for well-crafted and detailed descriptions for tasks. A minimal description is
            enough. Similarly, labels such as 'priority' can be omitted if you think they don't help you.</li>
          <li>Assign tasks to team members using the 'owner' field. At any point, there should be some ongoing tasks and some pending tasks against each team member.</li>
          <li>Use status labels to indicate which tasks are completed, which are ongoing, and which are to be done by next milestone.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Use milestones to indicate which issues are to be handled for which milestone by assigning issues to suitable milestones.</li>
          <li>Set the deadlines for milestones (in GitHub). Your internal milestones can be set earlier than the deadlines we have set, to give you a buffer.</li>
          <li>Note that you can change the milestone plan along the way as necessary.</li>
          <li>IMPORTANT: To consider the milestone as 'reached', <mark>you should have the following done <em>before</em> the tutorial begins. 'Missed milestones' will count against the 'project management' component of your final grade</mark>:
            <ul>
              <li>A working product tagged with the correct tag (e.g. v1.2) and pushed to the main repo.</li>
              <li>All tests passing on Travis.</li>
              <li>Milestone updated to match the product.</li>
              <li>Milestone closed. All issues assigned to that milestone should be closed too.</li>
              <li>Doing a 'release' on GitHub is optional for v1.1 and v1.2 but compulsory from v1.3.</li>
            </ul>

  <div id="handbook-appendixF-teamworkIssues">
    <div>
      <p>If your team is facing difficulties due to differences in skill/motivation /availability among team members,</p>
      <ul>
        <li>First, <mark>do not expect everyone to have the same skill/motivation level as you</mark>. It is fine if someone wants to do less and have low expectations from the module. That doesn't mean that person is a bad person. Everyone is entitled to
          have their own priorities.</li>
        <li>Second, <mark>don't give up</mark>. It is unfortunate that your team ended up in this situation, but you can turn it into a good learning opportunity. You don't get an opportunity to save a sinking team every day 😃</li>
        <li>Third, if you care about your grade and willing to work for it, you need to take initiative to turn the situation around or else the whole team is going to suffer. Don't hesitate to <mark>take charge</mark> if the situation calls for it. By doing
          so, you'll be doing a favor for your team. Be professional, kind, and courteous to the team members, but also be firm and assertive. It is your grade that is at stake. Don't worry about making a bad situation worse. You won't know until you
          try.</li>
        <li>Finally, don't feed angry or 'wronged'. Teamwork problems are not uncommon in this module and we know how to grade so that you will not be penalized for others' low contribution. We can use Git to find exactly what others did. It's not your responsibility
          to get others to contribute.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Given below are some suggestions you can adopt if the project work is not going smooth due to team issues. Note that the below measures can result in some team members doing more work than others and earning better project grades than others. It
        is still better than sinking the whole team together.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Redistribute the work</strong>: Stronger programmers in the team should take over the critical parts of the code.</li>
        <li><strong>Enforce stricter integration workflow</strong>: Appoint an integrator (typically, the strongest programmer). His/her job is to maintain the integrated version of the code. He/she should not accept any code that breaks the existing product
          or is not up to the acceptable quality standard. It is up to others to submit acceptable code to the integrator. Note that if the integrator rejected your code unreasonably, you can still earn marks for that code. You are allowed to submit such
          'rejected' code for grading. They can earn marks based on the quality of the code. Also refer the workflow described in the 'A safer workflow using forks and pull requests' section of the Handbook: Appendix E (Using GitHub Project Hosting)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>If you have very unreliable or totally disengaged team members</strong> :</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Re-distribute project work so that such team members cannot bring down the entire team.</li>
        <li>However, do not leave out such team members from project communications. Always keep them in the loop so that they can contribute more any time they wish to.</li>
        <li>Furthermore, evaluate them sincerely and fairly during peer evaluations so that they do get the grade their work deserves, no more, no less.</li>
        <li>Be courteous to such team members too. Some folks have genuine problems that prevent them from contributing more although they may not be able tell you the reasons. Just do your best for the project and assume everyone else is doing their best
          too, although their best may be lower than yours.</li>
      </ul>
