<p><strong>Communication</strong>: Keeping a record of communications among your team can help you, and us, in many ways. We encourage you to do at least some of the project communication in written medium (e.g., GitHub Issue Tracker) to practice how to
  communicate technical things in written form.</p>
<p><strong>Collaboration platform</strong>: You are <mark><em>required to</em> use GitHub</mark> as the hosting and collaboration platform of your project (i.e., to hold the Code repository, Issue Tracker, etc.). See <a href="#handbook-appendixE-github">Appendix E</a>  for more info on how to setup and use GitHub for your project.</p>
<p><strong>IDE</strong>: You are recommended to use <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">Intellij IDEA</a> for module-related programming work. You may use the community edition (free) or the ultimate edition (free for students). While the use of Intellij
  is not compulsory, note that module materials are optimized for Intellij. Use other IDEs at your own risk.</p>
<p><strong>Revision control</strong>: You are <mark><em>required to</em> use Git</mark>. Other revision control software are not allowed.<br> The recommended GUI client for Git is <a href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/">SourceTree</a> (which comes bundled
  with Git), but you may use any other, or none.</p>
